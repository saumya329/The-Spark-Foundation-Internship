## Task 1: Prediction Using Supervised Learning 
The supervised learning is the learning in which we are given a dataset and we already know what our correct output should look like. In this learning we have a labled dataset. They are categorized as:
Regression: We are trying to predict results in continuous output
Classification: It is the process of predicting class of given data points.
In this task we need to predict the scores that a student will achive based on the number of study hours using Logistic Regression Model.
Tools: pandas, numpy, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib

## Task 2: Prediction Using Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning works by analyzing the data without its labels for the hidden structures within it, and through determining the correlations, and for features that actually correlate two data items. The most common is KMeans clustering algorithm. KMeans Algorithm is one of Unsupervised Learning Algorithm . It is algorithm for clustering where data points that are in the same group exhibit similar features. It consist of k clusters where the algorithm tries to fit the data point in exactly one cluster.
In this task we need to find the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually using sklearn iris dataset.
Tools: pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, seaborn, numpy

## Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail
In this task we need to explore the Superstore data to find out the weak and strong areas where we can work to make more profit.
Tools: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy

## Task 4: Exploratory Data Analysis - Sports
In this task we are going to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on IPL dataset. Indian Premier League(IPL) is the most attended cricket league in the world. It is contested between March to May every year where each team represent different states in India.
Tools: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy

## Task 5: Prediction Using Desicion Tree
Desicion Tree Classifier:It is a supervised learning algorithm which is used for both classification and regression problems in the form of trees that can be incrementally updated by splitting the dataset into smaller datasets. The result is stored in the leaf node.  Decision tree is a tree shaped  flowchart-like structure (reversed tree) with nodes (leaf), branches and  decision making conditions
In this task we need to predict the class of flowers based on iris dataset
Tools: pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn
